# Customer-Segmentation-Using-Quantum-ML
Quantum computing-based solution segments the credit card customers by leveraging historical data of customers.
## Product Overview
The solution harnesses historical customer data for segmentation, incorporating customer IDs and various features such as purchase frequency, credit limits, and the number of purchases. It formulates the clustering problem as an optimization problem and solves it using the D-Wave's hybrid solver. Additionally, the solution calculates the optimal number of clusters based on the silhouette score. Consequently, the model produces optimal customer clusters as output, valuable for marketing purposes.

## Product Highlight 

* The solution employs novel optimization based approach for clustering. Through iterative processes, it continually refines and identifies the optimal clusters tailored to specific scenarios.
* The solution uses quantum hybrid solvers from D-Wave to reduce the time and space required while providing better quality results.
